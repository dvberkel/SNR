## Fermi Paradox
The [Fermi Paradox][fermi] is

> the apparent contradiction between the lack of evidence and high probability
> estimates, e.g. those given by the Drake equation, for the existence of
> extraterrestrial civilizations. The basic points of the argument, made by
> physicists Enrico Fermi (1901â€“1954) and Michael H. Hart (born 1932), are: 
>
> * There are billions of stars in the galaxy that are similar to the Sun,
>   many of which are billions of years older than Earth.
> * With high probability, some of these stars will have Earth-like
>   planets, and if the Earth is typical, some might develop intelligent
>   life. 
> * Some of these civilizations might develop interstellar travel, a step the
>   Earth is investigating now.
> * Even at the slow pace of currently envisioned interstellar travel, the Milky
>   Way galaxy could be completely traversed in about a million years. 
>
> According to this line of thinking, the Earth should have already been visited
> by extraterrestrial aliens.
